# Custom Rules

* Never use the default tailwind-color-modifiers for colors
* Only use those provided by the theme (the theme is defined by @packages/ui/src/styles.css)
* or look up the tailwind guide here, when unsure which utility-classes are available
  * [tailwind-theme-guide.md](mdc:tailwind-theme-guide.md)
