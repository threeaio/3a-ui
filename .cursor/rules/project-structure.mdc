# Structure of this project 

* This is a monorepo usng turborepo
* ItÂ´s current structure is: 

* Root
  * packages
    * eslint-config (shared eslint config)
    * typescript-config (shared typescript config)
    * ui (this is the ui library. It contains a Tailwind 4 - shadCN-Based UI-Library that we use in all apps. It is based on tailwind 4 so no tailwind.config.js exists in any of the packages)
